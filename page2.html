  <p class="ikeacaption3"> IKEA is known for its vision to deliver great design that improves the everyday life of someone
    who loves afforable, reliable, functional, and forward-thinking products. In the year 2086, IKEA decided to
    experiment with different styles of furniture by collaborating with a wide-range of artists and designers
    for their new program, "IKEA TOMORROW".<br> <br>
    As apart of our capsule collection, we created an installation in Almhult,Sweden, showcasing our proposal,'Room 2086', for "IKEA TOMORROW".
    For this capsule, we designed a grid pattered rug, octogon shaped coffee table, concrete couch, and chair-bench-sectional hybrid with desk attached.
    We experimented with sillouette, material, and color palette in our design of essential home furniture.</p>
